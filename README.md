Trakr: An app for tracking the value of cryptocurrencies.

Front End: Ember.js, Bootstrap, Sass.
Backend: Rails.

User Stories.

As a user , before logging in I can see a sidebar with a selection of cyptrocurrencies.
                              I am greeted with a description of the app, with instructions
                              on how to use the app.

             after logging in I can click on the side bar coin icons to add them to my list
                              of personally track icons.
                              I can attach a note to my list of icons.

EDIT* I couldn't get Trakr to work in time, so I made a blog app in the attempt to
meet requirements and not lose out on outcomes(!) support. I do fully intend on finishing


I built this entire app in 12 hours so it's very unpolished. The first thing I did
was read 3 different tutorials on the process I was aiming to achieve. I found several
that approximated my goals, but none that fit exactly. Implementing auth on the back end
was the biggest challenege so far. I'm still not sure I have my controllers set up appropriately
for the has many though relationship my "comments" have to my blog posts, but it cruds sucessfully.

I tried to get fancy on the edit function, so it's not finished yet. I want to click edit and load
a form pre populated with comment/post data, but so far I can either load a form with the data, but not sucessfully update it, or I can load a form without preloaded data, and make a post. I started on
this process early ,early in the morning so perhaps it'll be an easier process after sleep.
