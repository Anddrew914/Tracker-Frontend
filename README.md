User Stories.

As a user , before logging in I can see a sidebar with a selection of cyptrocurrencies.
                              I am greeted with a description of the app, with instructions
                              on how to use the app.

             after logging in I can click on the side bar coin icons to add them to my list
                              of personally track icons.
                              I can attach a note to my list of icons.
